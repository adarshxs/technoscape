        <p> Water, the most vital natural resource, has touched every aspect of human life. Various anthropogenic activities are 
            threatening its very existence. If the judicious utilisation of remaining supplies is to be ensured, it is our 
            responsibility as human beings to search for viable conservation techniques. The international community has enthusiastically
            embraced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In particular, SDG 6 has become the guiding light for efforts to
            meet the rising water demand and avert a worldwide water crisis. In tune with the United Nations' goal to 'Ensure availability
            and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all' by 2030, we at Vellore Institute of Technology-Vellore, INDIA, 
            propose to host TECHNOSCAPE23, an international conference on Sustainable Technologies for Water and Wastewater Treatment, 
            from 14th to 16th December 2023. TECHNOSCAPE23 aims to provide a platform for water enthusiasts and environmental experts 
            to share their rich scientific experiences.</p>
